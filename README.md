# javascript_udemy_course_budget_app

I am currently taking a JavaScript course on [Udemy](www.udemy.com);

[The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course)

## This project is a budget app

The html markup and css styling was provided by the instructor. The JavaScript is written from scratch, but seeing as this is a code learning project most of it is "code-along" with the instructor. I am however constantly aiming at coding the "next" step before I watch the instructors solution. The comments in the code is as much for structuring the code as it is for my learning benefit.
